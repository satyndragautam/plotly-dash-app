# About app.py Confidentiality:

Thank you for visiting this repository! As you explore the functionalities and features of the deployed advanced analytic app, you may notice that the app.py file is not included in this repository. This decision was made to protect the confidentiality of the codebase, as the app is deployed in a public domain. While the app's functionality and user interface are publicly accessible, I have chosen not to share the app.py file to prevent unauthorized copying or replication of the proprietary code. However, I am more than happy to provide detailed documentation, code samples, or discuss the technical aspects of the app during interviews or discussions. Your understanding and respect for the confidentiality of this code are greatly appreciated.
