# ðŸ“ˆ: Discover how USA Population changes over time? 
This project aims to develop a web-based analytic dashboard allowing users to explore the dynamic landscape of population changes across the USA. Users can delve into detailed insights on age groups, racial demographics, gender, and more through interactive charts at the national, state, and county levels.

After completing the app layout design, my goal was to create an example dashboard that incorporates Plotly Dash components and demonstrates their usage. This dashboard aims to offer data-driven insights to a wide audience, including researchers, policymakers, and those simply curious about population dynamics. With its interactive features, the dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the diverse landscape of American demographics.

The objective of this project was to conduct research, analyze data, and uncover patterns and insights into how the US population changes over time. Furthermore, the aim was to develop an aesthetic web-based analytical dashboard to help the audience understand data trends across all US counties and gain insights into population changes over time. To achieve this objective, I gathered data from The US Census Bureauâ€™s Population and Housing Estimates Program (PEP), which provides detailed demographic information by county, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, it's important to note that the reporting and categorization methods employed by the Census Bureau for these populations have evolved over time. Additionally, the estimated data available at the US Census for population spans from 2010 to 2022. For more details, click here.

I recently completed the [IBM Data Science Professional Certification](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/SMB6GDH3KV6R) offered by Coursera. My continuous pursuit of learning about in-demand tools and technologies and integrating them into my expertise is what drives and motivates me. This project aligns with my broader objective of advancing my skills in Data Science and gaining a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of the field.

Throughout the certification program, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Plotly Dash, which introduced me to several other tools such as HTML and CSS. Alongside the course modules, I diligently practiced Data Science skills and undertook hands-on projects, which culminated in the development of my first web-based app.

  ### 1. Data Understanding & Data collection 
  Data Source : [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/)

To achieve goal of this project, I gathered data from The US Census Bureauâ€™s Population and Housing Estimates Program (PEP), which provides detailed demographic information by county, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, it's important to note that the reporting and categorization methods employed by the Census Bureau for these populations have evolved over time. Additionally, the estimated data available at the US Census for population spans from 2010 to 2022.

In addition to the initial data collection efforts, I explored the [US County Health Rankings & Roadmap](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/) as a potential data source. This platform is recognized for providing comprehensive information on various metrics including population, clinical care, income, and more, all in one centralized location.

Upon reviewing the data from this source spanning the last three years (2021 to 2023), I encountered inconsistencies in some columns, particularly for data ranging from 2010 to 2020. Additionally, there was an overwhelming volume of data consolidated into a single repository. Upon closer examination, I realized that this data did not align with the specific scope of the project. Therefore, I made the decision to forgo the utilization of data collected from this source. Instead, I chose to focus on alternative data sources that better fit the project's objectives and requirements.

<p style="color: red;"> Please Note: As I began this project and notebook, each step towards the end of this notebook became a learning experience. I made sure to learn at each step, and then I applied those lessons to the next steps. </p>

  ### 2. Performed data wrangling
  - Filtering the data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Tranforming the data and adding new columns
  - Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
  ### 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
  ### 4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
  ### 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
  - Selected required features, split the data, build models, tuned and performed evaluation to ensure an optimized model
  ### 6. Constructed a brief presentation report






# About app.py Confidentiality:

Thank you for visiting this repository! As you explore the functionalities and features of the deployed advanced analytic app, you may notice that the app.py file is not included in this repository. This decision was made to protect the confidentiality of the codebase, as the app is deployed in a public domain. While the app's functionality and user interface are publicly accessible, I have chosen not to share the app.py file to prevent unauthorized copying or replication of the proprietary code. However, I am more than happy to provide detailed documentation, code samples, or discuss the technical aspects of the app during interviews or discussions. Your understanding and respect for the confidentiality of this code are greatly appreciated.
